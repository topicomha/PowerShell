   <media:description>Fellow Patriots &amp; Freedom lovers, I was peacefully exercising my 1st Amendment Rights at the City Hall in Atlanta, Georgia when I was confronted by an unpleasant woman from the executive’s office who called law enforcement.

   <media:description>Fellow Patriots &amp; Freedom lovers, I was peacefully exercising my 1st Amendment Rights at the Marshall County Correctional Facility In the State of Mississippi. While there I was confronted by a Correctional Officer who told me to “Go Back to My Country” A short time after Law Enforcement arrived and tried to curtail my Free Speech but I wouldn’t let them! I will hold that Correctional Officer accountable for her Racist Comments! At the very least she would lose her position as a public servant.

   <media:description>Fellow Patriots &amp; Freedom lovers, I was peacefully exercising my 1st Amendment Rights at the Dekalb County Court House in Decatur, Georgia. At first, everything was going well, until I reached the Probation Department. I was confronted by Probation Officers &amp; eventually the Chief who were all not only ignorant on our 1st Amendment Rights, but spoke to me as if I was on Probation. When they realized I wasn’t going to back down they changed their tune and didn’t interfere…then I got to the District Attorneys Office…Please be sure to hit the like button and share! it truly helps spread this around for more Patriots to see it and I appreciate it!

We the People need to peacefully unite! Tyranny, has no place in our country! We demand accountability and change! All public contact information is below.

Fellow Patriots &amp; Freedom lovers, on June 14th 2022, I was peacefully exercising my 1st Amendment Rights at the United States Post Office Located In Hagerstown, Maryland. I was I’m almost immediately confronted by Postal Employees who were ignorant of their own rules and regulations. Hagerstown Police were called and when they arrived they immediately attempted to violate my constitutional rights. Officers Deavers &amp; Crause lies serval times in person and on the police report, stating that the postal employees ordered me to leave. This never happened, which the video clearly shows. My camera was ripped out of my hand by Ofc Crause and they place handcuffs on me so tight it cut my circulation and then hotboxed me in their cruiser. Despicable, Tyranical behavior. This department didn’t even have jurisdiction. We the People will hold them accountable! I do not have a court date yet but I will let you all know when I know.

   <media:description>Fellow Patriots &amp; Freedom lovers, I was peacefully exercising my 1st Amendment Rights at a USPS in Albany, New York. While there I came across a Postal Supervisor who not only was ignorant to her own regulations, but tried to use Terrorist Attacks &amp; Pandemics to justify her attempting to Violate my rights...I seriously couldn't believe it and wanted to share it with all of you.  Please be sure to hit the like button, it truly helps spread this around for more Patriots to see it and I appreciate it!

   <media:description>Fellow Patriots &amp; Freedom lovers, On June 2nd 2022 I was peacefully exercising my 1st Amendment Rights at the Law Enforcement Center located in Rome, Georgia. While recording some tax payer funded Police Vehicles in the Public Parking Garage I was confronted by three Georgia Bureau Of Investigation Agents. All three of them refused to identify themselves when asked and not only did they escalate the situation &amp; acted unprofessional they had a grave misunderstanding of the GA Stop &amp; ID statute. The next day I went to the GBI headquarters to try and hold them accountable…Please be sure to hit the like button, it truly helps spread this around for more Patriots to see it and I appreciate it!

   <media:description>Fellow Patriots &amp; Freedom lovers, As you know, On Tuesday May 24th 2022, 19 Children &amp; 2 Teachers at the Uvalde, Texas Elementary School, were massacred by a man that cannot be described in any other way other than pure evil. With new details coming to light, we are finding out that it took over an hour for law enforcement to breach the classroom and take out the shooter. Why is that? There’s more questions than answers but I felt it necessary to use my platform to discuss it. Please be sure to hit the like button, it truly helps spread this around for more Patriots to see it and I appreciate it!&#13;
