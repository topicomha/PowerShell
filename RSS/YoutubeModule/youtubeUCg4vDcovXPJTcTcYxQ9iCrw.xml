In the early days of YouTube, the platform was pretty much viral cat videos. Polished, well-produced content was virtually nonexistent. Funny enough, some of the first technically well-made YouTube content to break through the sea of mediocrity were FAKE how-to videos created by production duo &quot;Fatal Farm&quot;. Their series &quot;Infinite Solutions&quot; consisted of misleading how-to guides that appeared legit on the surface but would peddle out bad information and instructions causing viewers to waste time if they attempted to follow along. Due to how well the joke was disguised, the infinite solutions channel was treated as an unironic instructional channel in the youtube algorithm resulting in millions of people being trolled by their videos. One of infinite solutions most notorious guides was hot to install Google TV Beta, a service that didnt exists. The buzz created by this fake Google TV video got so insane, that google themselves had to make a public statement affirming to the public that google tv wasn't even a real thing. Today we will be looking back at the infinite solutions legacy, and its creators.

Back in 2013, a band known as Live Without performed in a venue once thought un-performable. They played a set inside of a Denny’s. Known as the “Denny’s Grand Slam” this bizarre concert was recorded and uploaded to YouTube and has since gone massively viral. Over the years the Denny’s Grand Slam show has become legendary…and with any good legend, there is a mysterious backstory. Many have speculated as to what led to this avant-garde concert, why Denny’s?. Well, I tracked down the band behind the Denny’s Grand Slam show to get the scoop on how this mythical concert came to be. This is the Legend of The Denny’s Grand Slam.


Big shoutout to Live Without for the interview. Check out their merch and music.

Its difficult to have a conversation about infamous YouTubers without bringing up a man known online as &quot;Stomedy&quot;. Stomedy was a reaction, prank, and challenge channel which rose to fame in the mid 2010's. Many of his challenge style videos went on to accrue millions of views simply off how ludicrous they were. Stomedy's absurd antics would eventually get the attention of large commentary YouTubers Pyrocynical and Leafyishere, kicking off one of the wildest youtube community battles in the history of the site. But once that battle was over, Stomedy almost immediately started falling into obscurity. What few know is that Stomedy is still around, and is engaging himself in activities arguably more bizarre than what made him famous in the first place. Today, i'll be diving into one of YouTube's weirdest rabbit holes. This is the story of Stomedy.

(Edit: 5/26/2022) Stomedy has responded to this video. Watch his response here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6D2lOvXfew&amp;t=29s

In 2021 It was announced that the beloved free-to-watch children's cartoon network Qubo, was shutting down. The network aired classics like Bob the Builder, Veggie Tales, Jay Jay the Jet plane and many other iconic kids classics. The shutdown date and time was announced to take place on February 28th at midnight. Many kids and adults tuned in to watch the final moments of Qubo on TV, it was expected to be a wholesome send off. But a video has surface on YouTube allegedly showing these final moments, and it can only be described as extremely disturbing. Today we will be looking into the Qubo shutdown incident and get to the bottom of one of the most bizarre rabbit holes in animation history.

Zazef was a YouTuber who joined the site nearly 14 years ago as a kid. By all means a member of the &quot;old school YouTube&quot; pantheon, Zazef was known for his dorkiness and love of RuneScape. But Zazefs true distinction on YouTube was his obsessive documentation of himself attempting to get a girlfriend. Viewers tuned in for years watching this lonely creator discuss his troubles with getting girls. He seemed so desperate that many believed him to be an elaborate troll playing a nerdy character for laughs. While this may have been true at times, Zazef seemed to genuinely suffer from his loneliness...and this loneliness would eventually lead to a tragic self destruction documented in real time. This is the tragic fall of Zazef, The kid who got hugged by a girl.

In the early days of YouTube, video game critics were dime a dozen. Thanks to the success of James Rolfe's Angry Video Game Nerd series, everyone was taking a crack and creating there own &quot;Angry&quot; video game review series. Almost all of these AVGN wannabes are lost to time, but was so hilariously bad that he is still remembered to this day. Eric, the PISSED OFF ANGRY HARDCORE GAMER. Eric's videos were so poorly planned and produced that they were funny for all the wrong reasons. He consistently made a fool out of himself in his videos, and became especially disliked when he dealt out scathing criticisms towards the Nintendo Gamecube. Today I would like to tell you all the story behind YouTube's most uniquely infamous video game critic. 

Video Credit:
Obviously, Eric himself for making the videos.

Sceneable’s Channel: https://youtube.com/channel/UCupRiRavF2PElYtyv0My9mg

Back in 2017 a young YouTuber known as Sceneable caused a bit of a stir when he advocated for the western world to adopt communism. His video &quot;we need communism&quot; made him a pariah, and he was mocked and criticized throughout various YouTube communities. But the criticism only seemed to embolden Sceneable, and he pushed back and remained steadfast in his ideals. This is the story of Sceneables rise to YouTube infamy, his battle with the community, and what has happened to him in recent years.

Many familiar with the weird side of YouTube likely know about &quot;Five or Six Stores&quot; and its various counterparts. Bizarre acting videos spread around the site, that appear to be some sort of leaked audition recorded sometime in the 80s or 90s. The videos have established something of a cult following over the years, with some of the acting tapes receiving multi-million view counts and many of them being remixed for comedic effect. What is the story behind these mysterious acting tapes? Where did they come from, when were they filmed, and of course, who was responsible for their creation? This is the story behind Five or Six Stores.

In 2017 a small YouTuber known as &quot;HandHeldGameFan&quot; was in a bad situation. His wheelchair van had broken down, essentially trapping him at home until repairs were made. However, he didn't have the money for repairs...So he went out on a limb and asked the few dozen peopled who watched his videos if they would pitch to in to a GoFundMe for the van repairs. One might not expect much to come from this, but what happens was unbelievable. Thanks to the kindness of his fans, the video was shared to reddit which was then pushed to the front page of the site. There was a collective online effort to fix this mans wheelchair van and this is that story.

RTX Morshu by Hoolopee: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Rj9mHj79E

Morshu is easily one of the most iconic memes in history. Coming from the widely panned Zelda CDI title Link: Faces of Evil, Morshu became infamous when he and other characters from the game found themselves remix material for YouTube Poop videos. Curiously though, Morshu has had the longest shelf life, still remaining popular almost two decades after first becoming a meme online. Due to Morshu’s online cult following, many have become curious as to who was the man behind Morshu? Who was the voice actor responsible for delivering Morshu’s legendary dialogue? This seems like a simple question, but the answer has been all but impossible to determine for certain. This is due to the sloppy nature of the Zelda CDI games; the credits do not properly attribute voice actors. In recent years a focused investigation has been put forth by online sleuths attempting to solve this Morshu Mystery. Today marks an important step in that investigation. This is the story behind Morshu’s voice actor mystery.</media:description>

In 2016 Memes were entering the mainstream and a YouTuber known as Behind The Meme welcomed newcomers with open arms. Behind The Meme created dozens of videos on his channel that explained memes for those uninformed regarding their origins. He became immensely successful using this format gaining hundreds of thousands of subscribers in the process. However, with great success comes great criticism. And BTM got truckloads of it. BTM was often criticized for making &quot;low effort content&quot; that literally anyone could make. Additionally, some accused BTM was ruining meme culture, by making memes too accessible. Eventually, BTM found himself one of the most HATED YouTubers on the platform...and the hate would motivate him to make a series of shortsighted decisions that ultimately ruined his YouTube career. This is the bizarre downfall story of behind the meme.

Check out the MrBlackDarkness channel!  https://www.youtube.com/c/MrBlackDarkness666/videos

During the height of LeafyIsHere's YouTube empire in 2016, he was known for mocking a variety of other creators. One such victim of Leafy was a goth YouTuber known as MrBlackDarkness666. BlackDarkness found himself being mocked for his looks and goth lifestyle across a series of videos. Eventually, he would respond to Leafy in the most bizarre way possible; by casting a satanic curse on him. This is the story of one of the most hilariously ridiculous YouTube dramas of all time, and how MrBlackDarkness trolled his way to YouTube infamy with the help of LeafyIsHere.

Check out Misha's new music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZFAtiShAvU

The release of Pokemon GO was truly something special. It was a surreal time, folks put differences aside and came together for about a week to catch pokemon. When the game was going viral in July of 2016, many would take to YouTube to cash in on the trend by creative game guides and parodies....and some made songs. One such songmaker was a young boy from the Czech Republic known as Misha. Misha created the Pokemon Go song, a jingle with the simple lyrics: &quot;I PLAY POKEMON GO EVERYDAY&quot;. The video and the song itself were somewhat obnoxious, and Misha quickly became reaction fodder for youtube commentators. He was made fun of constantly and called cringe for his music. But what few realize is that Misha very much intentionally made obnoxious music to garner attention and fame, and his strategy worked wonderfully. This is the story of Misha, and what has happened to him in recent years.

Back in the day, YouTube karaoke singers were everywhere on the website. Some of these folks achieved notoriety for their singing ability or lack thereof. Probably the most infamous of all YouTube singers was CathyMay15. CathyMay, a Norwegian YouTuber began uploading pop song covers to her channel in 2011. She was very charming and charismatic but was by no means, Mariah Carey. Unfortunately for Cathy, she would become a target of 4chan, and face a great deal of trolling. This trolling would ultimately lead to her leaving the site, but she didn't go out without a fight. This is the story of CathyMay15.
